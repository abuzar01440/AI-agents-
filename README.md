This repo demonstrates an AI  Agent built using the LangChain framework and orchestrating complex workflows with LangGraph, all powered by the Llama 3.2 Instruct open-source model. 
The entire setup is designed to run seamlessly on the Kaggle platform.


# âœ¨ Key Technologies
-  LangChain: The versatile framework for developing applications powered by large language models. It provides the building blocks for creating chains and agents.
-  LangGraph: An extension of LangChain specifically designed for building robust, stateful, and multi-actor applications with LLMs. It allows for defining workflows as directed graphs, enabling loops, conditional logic, and advanced agentic behavior.
-  Llama 3.2 : A powerful open-source large language model from Meta. We're leveraging its instruct-tuned versions for both generation and reflection tasks.
-  Kaggle: The cloud-based platform providing the computational environment (including GPUs) necessary to run the Llama 3.2 model.


## Agents types
-  ReAct Agent using Langchain
-  Reflection Agent using LangGraph
-  Reflexion agents Agent using LangGraph
